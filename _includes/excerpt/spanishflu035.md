**SAM:** Well, what about the severity of this flu as you've been told about it?

**L O:** Well, it must have been a virulent form because a great many people were sick, and people died. People I knew of died. The superintendent of schools died. And there was what they called the SATC. It was something at the university. It was, oh, student, some kind of training. Anyhow, it was sort of like ROTC except that they had training here and then went right in to service. And I have heard that when they lined up to get flu shots and so on, some of them would be attacked by flu just while they were waiting, just fall there in line, just pass completely out. Dropping like flies was the way it was told here in town. Apparently, they were just keeling over with it. And the M. R. Lewis House, which is now an apartment house on Seventh and Adams, that was taken over as an auxiliary hospital. And people used to go there, my dad went there and volunteered and helped nurse flu patients. And the town activities were closed up; the movies were closed; the schools were closed; no public meetings were permitted. 

**SAM:** For very long? 

**L O:** I don't know. I suppose six weeks or maybe a couple of months would be the limit of it. 

**SAM:** Were the servicemen at the university hit the strongest? I've heard the flu, it associated with then particularly. I'm wondering whether it hit as hard against the town itself as against the servicemen? 

**L O:** I don't know, I don't know. But I think the town was badly hit. I think that few families escaped having somebody sick and there were a number of deaths. 

**SAM:** Do you have any idea of what the course of it was? If somebody got the flu was it a matter of weeks and weeks of sickness? 

**L O:** Oh, I don't think so. I think it went into pneumonia with the people that died. And that they died fairly—I don't think that it'd be terribly long time. This aunt of mine that I have told you about that lived in Lewiston was living alone, and somebody notified my dad that she was sick with the flu and needed help. And he went down there and stayed, oh I suppose maybe ten days or so and family tradition has it, it saved her life, because it had gone into uremic poisoning with her. And he just pitched right in and stayed with her day and night and took care of her and brought her through it. But everybody said she would have died if Father hadn't gone down there and looked after her because the doctors were just so overworked, and all the medical facilities were so overtaxed that people did just die for lack of attention. And by the time Dad heard about it and got down there, she was just not able to do anything for herself. And I can remember when he came back, he brought her up here. And she was the weakest most washed out thing—even I could see that, as young as I was. I suppose she stayed with us for two or three weeks, maybe a month or so before she got her strength back. It apparently was very debilitating for people . . .And of course they had no remedies for pneumonia at that time. And this was just something very, very. . . 

**SAM:** I wonder if people wore gauze face masks when they were treating. . .? 

**L O:** Um hum, it seems to me I remember people wearing face masks. But as I remember, it was a time of great gloom, that is all the news was bad and there was great head shaking and everybody was upset about it. It really brought things to a standstill in the town. There just weren't enough doctors to go around and not enough the doctors could do for it.
